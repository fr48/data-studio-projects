      <p class="body-text serif">Security startups shooting up left and right and it seems like there's plenty of money to go around. With CrowdStrike IPOing at $34 and hitting $100 a share in less than 2 months, and Duo Security nearing its one-year anniversary of being acquired by Cisco for $2.35 billion, cybersecurity is a booming business.

      <p class="body-text serif">An analysis of Crunchbase figures for cybersecurity startups--which includes companies that identify as cybersecurity, privacy, compliance, network, cloud security, identity management--found that while security investments continued to be strong over the fast 24 months, they have been on  decli

        <p class="chart-subhead">The first two quarters of 2018 was particularly good for startups trying to raise capital, since VCs were on a tear making deals. Since then the number of deals closed that year has declined.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">Early vs Late Stage Financing</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">While there is a decline in how many funding deals are being sighend on a quarter-by-quarter basis, the excitement is still there. VCs are still taking part in Series A-G rounds. While VCs continue to help launch a company with _seed_ funding,most of them appear to be willing to take a slower approach and wait for the startups to grow up a little bit more.<p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The median size of the funding deal shows that regardless of the type of financial round, startups will not be hurting for funds and investors. 2018 seems to be an outlier, with more deals. The median funding shows that both 2017 and 2019 had very similar amound of funds invested.

      <p class="body-text serif">Over the last 24 months, Angel and Pre-Seed rounding tend to be smaller sums of money, but about the same across the years. Series A and B is where the investors pull out the bigger guns.</p>
