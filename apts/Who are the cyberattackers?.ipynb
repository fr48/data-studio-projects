    "# Cyber Operations Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Council of Foreign Relations tracks known cyber operations and threat actor groups at https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations#CyberOperations\n",
    "\n",
    "The data _categorizes all instances of publicly known state-sponsored cyber activity since 2005_. Only incidents in which the threat actor is suspected to be affiliated with a nation-state are included. Only incidents where states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests are included. Furthermore, state-sponsored incidents generally have the most accurate and comprehensive reporting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data sources include: Florian Roth’s APT Groups and Operations spreadsheet, the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ list of significant cyber events, and Kaspersky Lab’s Targeted Cyberattacks Logbook\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributinon is tricky and is derived using a combination of technical data, open-source information, and an understanding of the threat actor’s foreign policy priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "No claims are made that the data contained within the tracker is entirely complete. There is a bias toward over-reporting incidents or threat actors affecting countries where English is widely spoken and published. Classified and proprietary information about incidents are not included. Incident reporting takes  time--some incidents get an attribution way after the operation becomes public. Some incidents may be missing."
