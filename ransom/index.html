      <p class="body-text serif">Ransomware doesn't discriminate. Over the past year, it has hit individuals, businesses, and municipalities. As the targets biggers, so have the ransom demands.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Incidents against cities have skyrocketed...from just two confirmed reports against cities in 2013, to 54 in 2018. There have already been 41 reports in the first seven months of 2019. </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Attackers are also getting bolder in their demands. In 2013, the mean ransom being demanded was $750. In 2016, that jumped, to about $9,500. Ransom demands dipped a little to $7,500 in 2017 and 2018, but the mean ransom in 2019 is already over $31,800. The attacker demands aren’t all outlandish. While some are super high, most stay within the same range.</p>    
      <div class="chart-section">
        <p class="chart-title">Soaring Ransom Demands</p>
        <p class="chart-subhead">Ransom demands used to be reasonable, with 1 or 2 Bitcoins. In recent months, the attackers have gotten bolder, and increased their ransom demands. </p>

      <p class="body-text serif">*The bulk of the jump happened in the second quarter of 2019, where the average ransom payment increased by 184 percent to $31,800, as compared to $12,000 in the first quarter of 2019, security company Coveware said.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">Quick Ransomware Primer</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">Ransomware is a particularly disruptive type of computer malware as it encrypts all the files on the computer, leaving the user unable to do anything on the machine. The user finds out the computer has been infected because there is a ransom note on the screen. 
        The idea is that once the user has paid the attacker the victim, usually using a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, the user would theoretically receive a decryption tool that would unlock the files and restore everything back to normal.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Whether or not to pay the ransom, however, is a difficult question. The FBI recommends not paying the ransom, because that would just encourage criminals to attack again and again, and that is evident in the way the ransom 
        payments have gone up in 2019, after several cities paid the ransom. If the choice is to not pay, the victim has to try to rebuild the system using backups. If there are no backups, then the data is lost forever. Some victims decide to pay because they <em>have to</em> get the data back .</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">The FBI doesn’t want to feed the criminals, so encourages not paying the ransom. Some municipalities pay, because they can’t get the data back any other way.  Less than 20 percent of cities impacted over the last seven years have paid the ransom--about the same number for incidents where we don’t know whether it was paid.</p>
      <div class="chart-section">
        <p class="chart-title">Pay or Not Pay?</p>
        <p class="chart-subhead">Everyone will answer this question differently, because there is no obvious answer. Paying is not a guarantee. Not paying may not be an option.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="body-text serif">However, there is a risk. You can pay, and still not get the data back. While Coveware’s report suggests that criminals behind Ryuk and Sodinokibi have a high recovery rate--96 percent of companies get their data back. However, for other ransomware, that is not necessarily the case. About 10 percent of incidents could not get all their data back.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">There is <em>also</em> a price to be paid for not paying--cost of recovery is extremely high. Atlanta refused to pay $50,000 ransom, and the Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms testified before a congressional subcommittee on cybersecurity that the city has paid $7.2 million. Baltimore refused the $76,000 ransom, and its price tag is so far $18.2 million and climbing. Lake City, on the other hand, did pay, and did not get all the data back.

        <h3 class="section-head serif">What Happens to the City?</h3>  
      <p class="body-text serif">When people get infected with ransomware, they may lose access to their photographs or their personal documents. When cities get infected, essential services go down. It’s not just documents. Email is down, so the only other way to contact the city is by phone. If the phone system gets shut down, then the only way to get in touch is in person. Libraries have lost internet. In some cases, birth certificates, marriage licenses, and death certificates cannot be recorded. The city can’t process credit card payments. Police don't have access to crime databases and have to record arrests on paper. In some cases, the bodycam footage becomes unavailable.</p>
      <div class="chart-section">
          <p class="chart-title">Residents are the Real Victims</p>
          <p class="chart-subhead">When cities get infected, essential services are impacted: taxes can't be collected, parking tickets can't be paid. There's no way to get married, either.</p>

    <div class="story-body">
      <h3 class="section-head serif">Case Study: Atlanta</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">As mentioned, when the city of Atlanta was infected with ransomware back in March 2018, the initial ransom demand was $50,000 at the time's Bitcoin value. City officials decided against paying the ransom and began the arduous task of restoring from backups. By the beginning of May, Atlanta had spent more than $2 million for its recovery costs. That doesn't count the economic impact of lost revenue or unavailable city services. Recovery is a slow process, and the city wound up having associated costs for up to 6 months after the breach.
        </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Looking at the numbers, not paying the ransom seems like a bad deal, as that is a lot of money Atlanta wound up paying for out of the city budget and from the taxpayers. Some of it was fpr rebuilding the infrastructure and getting new servers, most of it was for staff overtime and paying for consultants to help with the cleanup process. There was also a bill for a communications agency to handle how the city released its information on its efforts as well as for a waste disposal to get ride of the no longer usable machines.
        </p>
        <div class="chart-section">
            <p class="chart-title">Where Does the Money Go?</p>
            <p class="chart-subhead">Recovery isn't just a matter of copying the data back. Consultants have to be paid, staff deserve overtime. New systems have to be purchased. Maybe new security features need to be added.</p>
            <div class="chart-row">
              <div class="chart">
                <img src="images/atlantawaffle.png"/>
              </div>
            </div>



      <p class="body-text serif">Many of the above expenses will still have been the case even if the ransom had been paid. There still needs to be a communications team, and fees for consultants. Support staff will still need overtime, and incident response is still part of the equation. Some of these expenses will be in addition to the ransom, so it's rarely the case that the ransom is the only thing the municipality will have to pay.
      </p> <p class="body-text serif">“We’re not going to pay criminals for bad deeds. That’s not going to happen,” said Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young, responding to a question about the cost of recovery and lost revenue being much larger than the original ransom demand. Even if the city were to pay the ransom, “there’s no guarantee that if you pay, you reset your system,” Young said.
